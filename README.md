# WFSC444GroupProject
HTML program used to control a game of ecology-themed bingo.

In order to open the Bingo program, ensure that all of the files here are stored in the same directory on your system. Then, in your web browser, navigate to the ecobingo.html file.
For example, the path to mine on my computer is 'C:\Users\John\WFSC444' so in my web browser I would type 'C:\Users\John\WFSC444\ecobingo.html'. If you have it saved in your downloads
folder, you are most likely going to type 'C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\WFSC444\ecobingo.html'. To edit what hints are used, you can either edit the hints.txt file, or manually enter
your own hints for each round of bingo, though the program is set to save the hints.txt file and reuse those for each round.
